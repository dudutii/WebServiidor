    <h2 class="mb-3">agriculture</h2><img src="/imagens/uploads/noticia_1_1762406952.jpg" alt="Imagem" class="img-fluid rounded mb-4">    <p style="text-align: justify;">As agriculture continues its digital transformation, autonomy is becoming a key driver of productivity, safety, and sustainability. From manual operation (Level 0) to fully autonomous systems (Level 5), each stage represents a leap in how machines perceive, decide, and act in the field.

This structured evolution mirrors the path seen in autonomous vehicles — but tailored to the unique challenges of farming: variable terrain, weather, crop dynamics, and safety requirements.

Understanding these levels helps us assess not only where we are today, but also what technologies will define the future of smart agriculture — from GNSS-assisted steering and path planning to AI-driven decision making and full robotic autonomy.</p>
